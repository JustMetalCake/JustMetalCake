### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I am a budding Software Developer in the UK having begun my journey in June '22. Having been a professional musician for 8 years, my interest was piqued in software and I have been fascinated ever since.

With every aspect I learn, I find another 10 things I am amazed by and want to figure out how to make it work. The majority of my learning has been in Python, with a dabbling in a few other languages to see where I wanted to start.
