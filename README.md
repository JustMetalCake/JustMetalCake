### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I am a Junior Software Developer in the UK, having begun my learning journey in June '22 and started a full time role in Jan '23. 
Having been a professional musician for almost a decade, my interest was piqued in software and I have been fascinated ever since.

The main stack I use is Laravel, Vue & Tailwind, but have also been gaining experience with Alpine & Livewire (to complete the TALL stack). Recently I have been working with FilamentPHP which I have found to be flexible, powerful & has a great many features already built in which has shown care & consideration by the creators.

As I have been learning & using these technologies more, I am starting to get into open source contributions as I would like to share any niche uses & functionality that I think other users may benefit from. I appreciate every piece of feedback I get, so I can continue to improve & further my knowledge.
